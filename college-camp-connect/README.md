**College Camp Connect** is a subscription-based mobile app designed **for athletes only**.  
It provides a simple, visually clean way to explore and register for camps and clinics hosted by colleges and universities nationwide.  

Athletes can:  
- 🔍 **Browse and search camps** in list or calendar view  
- 📅 View event **dates, times, and locations**  
- 🏫 See which **college/university** is hosting  
- 🎯 Check **eligibility/age requirements**  
- 🔗 Access **direct registration links**  
- 💲 Compare **costs** across different opportunities  

All events are submitted by coaches and camp directors via [campsandclinics.com](https://campsandclinics.com/) and appear automatically inside the app.
